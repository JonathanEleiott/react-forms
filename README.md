# React Forms & JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## React Forms

- form element in JSX
  - onSubmit will be used to run a function when the user submits the form
- input elements inside
  - useState will be needed for each input
  - onChange will be used to track and save what the user is typing
- button for submitting

## JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

- user logs in
- they are given a unique JWT
- they send the JWT with all future requests to prove who they are
- the JWT can be set to expire (think banking apps)
